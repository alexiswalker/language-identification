This means you’ll be able to see accurate, consistent and bright images from any viewing point.                     Innovational OSD operation             ST1019 not only sets five “F Keys” for waveform, vectorcope, color histogram, peaking focus and so on, but also has “3 Group User Presets” to reserve the knob for the professional users. Double functions and knob switch is SEETEC's exclusive technology feature, which will bring you more convenient and rapid operation feeling.                                    Multiple Inputs and Outputs         Multiple input formats meet the needs of the professional input and display functions with all HD, SD, analogue video signal inputs. The monitor comes with 2x3G HD-SDI, HDMI, Composite, and Component Input and Ouput. ST789 has both HDMI and SDI in and out, to allow it not onlydisplay live signals, but also send them out to other monitors simultaneously. It’s able to display live picture on multiple displays at the same time while it still maintains the original. video quality.                       Gimbal Bracket                                  Portable Aluminum Suitcase          (Optional Accesories)                 Features        1. Seamless Switch    2. Vetor Scope    3. Color Histogram    4. Histogram    5. Peaking Focus Assist(Red/ Green/ Blue/ White Outline)    6. Camera 5D II Mode    7. Check Field (Mono/ Red/ Green/ Blue)    8. Scan Mode    9. False Color    10. Exposure    11. Squared Segmentation (Zoom One of the Images to Realize Full Screen)    12. Pixel-to-Pixel    13. Mirror image (L/D, L/R)/ Freeze    14. Embedded Audio    15. Zoom-in    16.Ratio (4:3/16:9)    17. Center Marker/ Screen Marker    18. Color Temp-adjustment    19. Markers (l6:9, 4:3, 2.35:1, 1.85:1) with Red, Green, Blue, White,Gray, Black Color             Waveform          This essential feature assists with the calibration of professional video cameras. It shows the overall brightness of the image assisting the video professional in correcting exposure. The waveform feature also checks the evenness of the lighting when lighting a chromakey or background.            Vectorscope          Vector scope shows how saturated the image is and where the pixels in the image land on the color spectrum. It can also be displayed in various sizes & positions, that allows users to monitor color gamut range in real time.           RGB Histogram         Color histogram is a graphical display of the distribution of tones, exposure conditions can visually display screen is divided into R, G, B three-channel independent display. Suitable for HD-SDI and HDMI signal monitoring.               Histogram       The Brightness Histogram is a quantitative tool to check the picture brightness.The feature shows the distribution of brightness in an image as graph of brightness along the horizontal axis (Left:Dark, Right:Bright)and a stack of the number of pixels at each level of brightness along the vertical axis.                          Peaking Focus Assist          The Peaking Filter is used to aid the camera operator in obtaining the sharpest possible picture, which is most effective when the subject is properly exposed and contains enough contrast to be processed. Peaking focus assist of ST789 has High-low level to adjust.                     False Color          False color can be intuitive observation and calculation in the scene lighting levels, to make the brightness or the lighting value mapping for the display brightness of false color, from the darkest to the brightest, in turn display blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange and red.                           False Color Key        To best utilize this feature, you must understand the color chart and have a basic understanding of camera exposure. Normally, when shooting subjects like people, it is common practice to set exposure of faces to the equivalent of approximately 56 IRE. The False Color filter will show this area as the color PINK on the monitor. Therefore, as you increase exposure (open the IRIS), your subject will change color as indicated on the chart: PINK, then GREY, then a few shades of YELLOW. Overexposed subjects (above 101 IRE) on the monitor will be shown as RED. In addition, underexposed subjects will show as DEEP-BLUE to DARK-BLUE, with clipped-blacks indicated with a FUCHSIA-like color. Lastly, the color GREEN is used to indicate elements of the image that are approximately 45 IRE. This represents a \"neutral\" or \"mid-level\" exposure commonly used for objects (not people)                  Embedded Audio       The Audio Level Meters provide numerical indicators and headroom levels. It can generateaccurate audio level displays to prevent errors during monitoring.       Exposure        The Exposure is used to assist in exposure adjustment in the mode of Zebra Pattern.                            Center Marker       Frame Marker        Frame Mark (80%, 85%, 90%, 93%, 96%) View Finding and Composition                    Squared Segmentation      Zoom one of the images to realize the full screen                      Packaging & Shipping        Gift&neutral box 10 pcs/carton         Delivery Information:   SEETEC strives to get all orders out as quickly as possible after QC Dept fully test them!
