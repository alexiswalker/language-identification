    "review_content": "Hi I have purchased a HP 15-af024AU APU Quad Core A8 - (4 GB DDR3\/1 TB HDD\/Windows 8.1) Notebook (15.59 inch, Turbo SIlver Color With Diamond & Cross Brush Pattern) form Flipkart on August 3rd 2015 . I have paid the complete amount through online. A offer for HP Laptop bag was bundled with this product which Flipkarthaven't sent to me which was received on 8th August. On speaking to their customer care they are straight away denied of about the offer. And meanwhile they have even update their website without the offer.This is really a kind of deceiving the customers and I want justice and need to resolve at the earliest.regards, Vittal\t\tDear Vittal,Greetings from Flipkart.com!We regret to inform you that we were unable to find the order details.

    "review_content": "Flipkart is bogus online shoping site. They do not respond to customer queries. I have purchased Asus Zenphone 2 phone worth rs 14999, on 14 august 2015. The phone was not getting on. After charging it came up and shows 50 % battery, after taking few photos the phone shuts down again. I again charge it and install system upgrade, after that I made a call and the phone shone shuts down again. There was also burning smell coming from the back panel of the phone that is from battery side and it was getting very hot while charging so I discontinued the use of this phone and raise a request for replacing the phone. I got a message that we'll call you tomorrow at 5.30 pm, but nobody called and I got a message that we'll call you at 2.30 pm again nobody called and instead of their phone I again got a message that we'll call you at12.00 pm. I also call on flipkart customer care for replacing the phone, but they said that they are not authorized person for making this decision. Flipkart just want to sell phones and do not care if the phone bursts. I will not contact to consumer court for this as I didn't get any response from your side. Even nobody pics up the call easily in your customer care support and hangup many times.\t\tDear Varunmamgain,Greeting from FlipkartWe regret to inform you that, you have not provided the registered mobile number or order number, hence we request you  to provide the same for the further assistance.Thank you for shopping with Flipkart.com\t\tDear Varunmamgain,Greeting from FlipkartWe regret to inform you that, you have not provided the registered mobile number or order number, hence we request you  to provide the same for the further assistance.Thank you for shopping with Flipkart.com\t\tDear Varunmamgain,Greeting from FlipkartWe regret to inform you that, you have not provided the registered mobile number or order number, hence we request you  to provide the same for the further assistance.Thank you for shopping with Flipkart.com",
