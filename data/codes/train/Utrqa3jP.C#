Sorry for the formatting, udemy hates me...

What would your verdict be on making a menu system using enums... for example...

NOTE: Sorry for the mess, it was just an idea, I haven't tested it, I just wanted to see if it would be worth making (The syntax is probably a bit off). Also each piece of code in between [] is just english explaining what would happen.

	Enum enumName {Start, Quit};

	enumName myEnumName;

	if(myEnumName == Start)
	{
	[The sprite changes to the same image but the word *"Start"* is highlighted]

		if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.S))
		{
			myEnumName = Quit;
		}
	Application.LoadLevel("Game");
	}
	else if(myEnumName == Quit)
	{

	[The sprite changes to the same image but the word *"Quit"* is highlighted]

		if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.W))
		{
		myEnumName = Start;
		}
		Application.Quit();
	}
