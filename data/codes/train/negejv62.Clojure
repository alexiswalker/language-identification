(defn multirequest
  "Returns an async channel that will take a single value from any channel that is parked on it.
   Whenever you start an async request you should park an empty 'result' channel here.
   When your request completes you may indicate more requests by parking additional 'result' channels before
     pushing the result of your request onto its result channel.
   When there are no 'result' channels remaining on the multirequest channel it completes and invokes the callback
     function with a list of results."
